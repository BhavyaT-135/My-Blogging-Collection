# A Beginner‚Äôs Handbook to Open Sourceüåüüìó
If you‚Äôre a beginner having little or no idea about Open Source, then you have come to the right place to get started. In this article, I will give the readers a simple yet descriptive insight into how the world of open source functions.

Open source is a term that was originally coined to refer to Open Source Software(OSS). Open Source Software is software that is designed to be publicly accessible ‚Äî people can see, modify and distribute code as they see fit.

In fact, many of the modern software that you use today is Open Source. From amazing web browsers like Mozilla Firefox, and operating systems like Linux, to programming languages like Python, Open source has taken the world by storm.

You can‚Äôt talk about Open Source with GitHub out of the equation. GitHub is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. In layman‚Äôs terms, GitHub is home to many diverse projects in the form of repositories, hosted by gargantuan organizations to individuals.

Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git is a Distributed Version Control System. So, Git does not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project‚Äôs files.

From now on, we will follow a step-by-step guide on how to begin your open source journey. From finding the right project to mastering the art of contribution, we will try to cover every minute detail to give you the head start you need.

# Explore GitHub Projects üóÉ

GitHub is home to countless open source projects, reputed organizations, and that means, endless opportunities. So, if you haven‚Äôt already, start scraping. Before you dive into searching the right project for yourself, I‚Äôd like to pitch in a few pointers to help you make the process a little easier.

## Sort down your preferences ‚ú®

The first and foremost thing to keep in mind is prioritizing your strengths. Out of the many repositories available on GitHub, there is room for every skill to nourish. Be it graphic design, software development, or technical documentation, all you need is persistence and some research.

Try listing down your skill set on a piece of paper and search for projects that include it in their prerequisites. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be the jack of all trades. Be the master of one.‚Äù Stick by your skills and hone them. The key is consistency.

## Shortlist projects that match your skills üñä

The most beautiful thing about Open Source is its endless list of repositories and the fact that you can contribute to as many projects as you wish. Shortlisting projects might seem difficult at first, but it‚Äôs not that hard when you have the right approach.

Filtered searching through GitHub‚Äôs database might be a very efficient way to get started. Look out for news updates on Open Source Software by various social media platforms. What I would suggest is going through the list of projects mentioned in Open Source Programs like GSoC, Outreachy, etc., and select the project of your choice.

## Go through the Project README üìú

The mark of an A-Grade project is an A-Grade README. More likely than not, every Open Source Software maintains a README file along with the source code. The purpose of the README file is to summarize the objectives of the project, describe its workflow, provide guidance to new contributors, etc.

While downsizing the list of projects to consider, a good README can help you make decisions quicker. An attractive and elaborate README file is an indication of a well-maintained project. I‚Äôve mentioned Fonoster‚Äôs README as an example for the readers.

## Check out the Source Code üíª

Now that we‚Äôve shortlisted the projects to pursue, we‚Äôre good to begin pondering over the source code. The next phase is going through the source code and getting a grasp on the functionality of the software. Henceforth, you can fork the repository into your account and clone the project in your local machine.

The one thing I would advice newcomers would be to never give up. In the beginning, you might face difficulties in setting up the project on your local machine, understanding the workflow, or deciding how to contribute. However, you will only get the hang of it if you try. As you gain more experience, what seems hard in the beginning would become simpler with time.

# Hustle & Contribute üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We did our research and have selected a project of our desire. After gathering adequate information via the README and source code, it is finally time to make a place for yourself among the contributors of the project. While making contributions, keeping a few points in mind might give you the edge you need:

- You can contribute in various ways. Don‚Äôt bind yourself to one.
- All contributions are significant. Don‚Äôt hesitate to express your efforts.
- Don‚Äôt let roadblocks halt you. Seek help and support from the community.
- Keep contributing as much as you can because every contribution counts in the long run.

# Maintain your own README üì∞

It is without a doubt important to work hard, but it is also important to let the world know your hard work. A GitHub profile README is a feature of GitHub that allows users to create a markdown file to write details about themselves such as their skills, socials, etc.

It can be used to display your GitHub stats and badges and showcase them to the GitHub community. It is visible at the top of your GitHub home page, above the pinned repositories. This is a fancy and attractive way to demonstrate your work report on GitHub.

# Conclusion üèÅ

Throughout this article, I have tried to guide the newcomers to the best of my knowledge. From getting started and scraping repositories to contributing and creating your own README, everything has been clearly described.

Here on, I‚Äôll pass the baton in your hand. Go out there and feel free to explore your interests and develop your skills. Do not hesitate to communicate, express your thoughts, and contribute in whichever way possible. Devote your time and Open-Source will definitely open windows of opportunities for your career.
